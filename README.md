## Challenge Overview 
Upon completing the initial summary of candidate results, the election board requested analyis on the county results. using the same election_results.csv file and the same software, results were tallied and the percentage calculated for all counties in the dataset.

- Counties represented in the results include: 
  - Jefferson
  - Denver
  - Araphahoe
- The county results include: 
  - Jefferson County with 10.5% of the vote for a total of 38,855 votes. 
  - Denver County with 82.8% of the vote for a total of 306,055 votes.

This report provides an overview of percentage by candidate and count for total votes cast. This same analysis can be completed on local, state or federal election audits. Additional analysis that could strengthen the report include: 
 - Total votes and percentage of total votes by candidate by county. 
 - A comparison of the percentage of votes cast by total population per county. 
Adding these additional metrics would provide the election board information on counties with the highest percentage of voter turnout and support increased undestanding for candidates of their constituent base by geographic location.
